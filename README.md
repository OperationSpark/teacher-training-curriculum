### An intro to HTML 

Hyper Text Markup Language, also known as HTML, is a markup language made of tags that help describe content. Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer read and display HTML pages. The browsers don't actually display the HTML tags themselves but only the content between them. 

Here's an example of some HTML:

```HTML

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First HTML Page</title>		
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is a heading</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
	</body>
</html>

```

Each tag is described below:
* The `<DOCTYPE>` up top tells the browser that this is an HTML document. 
* The `<HTML>` tags show where to start and end the HTML document.
* The `<head>` tags provide information about the document
* The `<title>` tags set the title of the page which you'll see at the top of the browser window.
* The `<body>` tags are where the actual content of the page starts and ends
* The `<h1>` tags make the text a heading. 
* The `<p>` tags make the text a paragraph

HTML tags almost always come in pairs where they envelope content. The beginning and ending tags are identical except for the ending tag having a slash.

```HTML
<h1>This is some content</h1>
```
